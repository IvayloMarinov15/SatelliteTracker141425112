# SatelliteTracker 
Project by Ivaylo Marinov (141425112)

This program is a simple satellite tracking simulation written in the C programming language.
The goal of this project is to practice basic C concepts such as loops, variables, user input, and output.

The program does not track real satellites. Instead, it simulates a satellite moving around the Earth by updating its position over time.

This project was created as part of a university programming assignment for learning purposes.

# What does it do?
Asks the user to enter a satellite name

Asks the user to enter the satellite’s speed (in degrees per second)

Updates the satellite’s position every second

# Shows:

The current position in orbit (degrees)

The total distance traveled (kilometers)

Runs continuously until the user stops it by pressing "ctrl + C"
